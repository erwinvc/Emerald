## Projects
### Neural network
I used Emerald to create a visualization of a neural network I developed as a learning project.

### Maze generator
I also used Emerald to create a small prototype in which a maze with locks and keys was generated. This maze was created using cyclic dungeon generator based on [Unexplored](https://www.aiandgames.com/2021/01/28/unexploreds-secret-cyclic-dungeon-generation)

The generated maze can be traversed in a first person perspective.
